# ByteAcademy Phase 1

**This repository contains all material associated with the Phase 1 of both the Full-Stack and Data Science Curriculum**

## Goals

Students should be fully comfortable with the Python programming language after completion of this phase. This ranges from leveraging the built-in syntax and semantics that make up the language, as well as understanding the libraries to build complex applications designed to solve a broad range of problems.
