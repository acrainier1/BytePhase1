# Introduction to Computer Science

## What is a Computer
* A computer at its most fundamental just contains **memory** (hardrive, ram, cache) and a **logic unit** (CPU, GPU) that manipulates the memory
  * The memory is just numbers (really just 1s and 0s) and the logic unit just adds and sub2tracts these numbers
  * Doing over 100,000 of these computations each second results in the sophisticated programs you see on your computer

## What is a Programming Language
* A human-friendly way to instruct the computer how to use its **logic unit** to manipulate its **memory**
  * A programming language simply provides us with a human-friendly abstraction of computer memory and how to manipulate it
  * The programming language we will use is Python

## What is Python
* Specification (docs.python.org) vs Implementation (github.com/python)
  * Rules of the language specified abstractly. Can be implemented in any language
  * Most popular implementation is in C (due to performance benefits of C)
  
## Why Python
* Easy to learn
* One of the most popular overall - most popular for data science
* Extensive library
