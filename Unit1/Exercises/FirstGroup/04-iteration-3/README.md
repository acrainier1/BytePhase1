#### Challenge

* Create a variable named `data` and assign it to the array below

```
[2, 34, 12, 29, 37, 1, 12, 8, 8, 9, 29, 38, 8, 9, 2, 3, 7, 10, 12, 8, 34, 7]
```
* Write a function, `basic_stats`, that will take in this variable and print the following:
  * the mean (the average)
  * the median (the middle number when in order)
  * and mode (the number that occurs most frequently)

Please see the example `input` and `output` below.

```
[input]
basic_stats(data)

[output]
mean: 14.5
median: 9
mode: 8
```
