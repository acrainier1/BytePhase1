# Don't Hesitate, Iterate!!!

#### Description

Practice makes perfect. Here's some practice with iteration and variables.

---

#### Challenge

* Write a loop inside the function, `my_loop`, that takes a number `n` and prints the numbers `1`, `2`, ... all the way up to `n-1`.
* Write another function, `my_reverse_loop`, that does the same as `my_loop` but in reverse.


Use the following starter code:

```
def my_loop(n):
    # write your code here
    # you'll have to delete "pass"
    pass

def my_reverse_loop(n):
    pass
```

Then make it so the following happens:
```
[input]
my_loop(10)

[output]
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
```

```
[input]
my_reverse_loop(5)

[output]
4
3
2
1
```
